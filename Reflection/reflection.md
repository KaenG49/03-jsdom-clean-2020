# Reflection

This exercise relies on Wikipedia to turn a simple text table into "linked data". In the following exercies, you'll be asked to think about where this model can and cannot be replicated. You will probably want to use markdown source blocks and tables in some of your ansers. You can create a table with vertical pipes:

```markdown
Header 1 | Header 2
---------+---------
Content cell 1 | Content Cell 2
Content Row 2 | Content Row 2
```

The block above uses fenced code blocks to show the table syntax; you might use code blocks for other purposes in this reflection, as well.

## Question 1 (150 words)

#### Our underlying dataset was a list of political leaders. Describe another possible dataset which could use Wikipedia in the same way. Give an example of a possible Javascript object description of one record in the dataset, using the Javscript objects from Parts 1 and 3 as a starting point.

## Question 2 (150 words)

#### Now describe another dataset for which Wikipedia would **not** be as good a resource. What does this tell you about the limitations of Wikipedia? WHat kind of work would you need to do to make useful links for this dataset?

## Question 3 (150 words)

#### Finally, what problems do you see with this tabular format? What are its limitations, and what do they suggest more broadly about the limitations of data-based historical/humanistic inquiry?

Data-based inquiry in the field of history is susceptible to be insufficient when qualitative information and discourse overpowers the quantitative material for a particular topic. Tabular data presentation may be suitable for superficial qualitative information (such as 'party affiliations' or 'years in office' for political leaders) or to get quick quantitative information (e.g. Allied casualties in WW1 with each row corresponding to a different participant). However, topics that require in-depth analysis may struggle if they are to be depicted in a tabular data format. If selected, the tabular format may look weird to show quantitative data regarding in-depth information. For example, if you decide to show "foreign soviet interventions," you may want to explain the reason behind the intervention, as just stating the 'intervened country' and the 'year of intervention' is not qualitatively rich. However, the reasons behind these interventions are in-depth, and a qualitatively rich answer would take more space than a conventional tabular data cell, deeming tabular format insufficient.
